# TitanicML-Project
Project for Vertically Integrated Project at Georgia Tech


The Titanic ML Project was an assignment for my Automated Algorithm Design class. 
The task was to take historical data from the Titanic crash and predict whether people survived based on categories such as gender, class, embark location, etc. 
I achieved approximately 84% accuracy and experimented with different classifiers and models.
